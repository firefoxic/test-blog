Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! This is where I'll be talking about my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Astro Setup**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Creating Pages**: I then learned how to create pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Creating blog entries**: This is my first blog entry! I now have Astro pages and posts in Markdown format!

## What's next

I will complete the Astro tutorial and then continue to add more posts. Stay tuned for updates.
